Today, we are implementing (a) the button readouts, and (b) the LED movement code.

We'll need the hexadecimal format of the binary numbers:

0010 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000

0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000

0000 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000

Can you work these out from previous lessons?

Which bit-line is set to 1 in each of the above cases? - How do these correspond to the port numbers used?
