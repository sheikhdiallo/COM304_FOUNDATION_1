Logisim does not model gate delays. Logisim is not appropriate for this kind of simulation which requires gate delays to provide the expected results. For some circuits you may get what you expected, out of luck, due to the order the software evaluate the logic level changes.

Really good https://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/armTutorial/index.html   This reader introduces the basics of ARM v7 assembly. The primary goal is to help students who already know how to program in a high level language learn about the form their programs take after compiling - the kinds of instructions a computer really processes information. These materials provide examples of basic ARM instructions, assembly programming constructs, and how high level languages constructs are represented in assembly.

This is the source code for an interactive ARM v7 assembly tutorial. A live version of the tutorial can be found here: http://computerscience.chemeketa.edu/armTutorial/index.html

The goal of the tutorial is to understand assembly well enough to understand how high level code and data are implemented and develop familiarity with working with assembly and with binary representations of data.

### jtag urart

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62073642/how-can-i-get-an-input-from-a-user-with-using-cpulator-in-arm-assembly-language

Well, you're on the right track. The pushbuttons of CPUlator correspond to the bits in the word in memory at the fixed address of 0xFF200050. So the following will read the word into the r0 register:
```
ldr r0, =0xFF200050  //Load the address into a register
ldr r0, [r0] //Load the contents of that address
//Now let's do something with that number...
```

If you check, for example, pushbuttons 0 and 2, that'll give you 5 in r0. Will that do?

The memory address that the button state can be read from is helpfully written in the panel header of CPUlator on the right. The switches panel corresponds to the word at 0xFF200040. I'm not sure what's at 0xFF200100. On a physical device, pushbuttons and switches are probably distinct, but in the CPUlator, I can't see any difference. Use the input source that you like better.

There's also a keyboard panel in the devices, but the processing of that would be more involved.

http://www-ug.eecg.toronto.edu/msl/nios_devices/dev_jtaguart.html  really good discussion toronto
The Data Register is used for both sending and receiving data — the type of instruction executed (stw or ldw) determines whether you send or receive. Every time you read from this register an 8-bit data byte is ejected from the receive FIFO, and every time you write to it you insert a byte to the send FIFO. Note that reading the data register word will obtain the "Number of Bytes available" in bits [31:16], data valid [15], and will also read the data in bits [7:0] and eject another byte (if any) from the queue. The "Number of Bytes available" returns the utilization of the queue before the current read operation.

The simulator cannot communicate with actual external devices or files, but it can simulate writing to and reading from a UART in its JTAG UART box. The box gives the base address of the UART at 0xff201000, and we use this address to communicate with the simulated UART.

### vnc with tight vnc on pi

https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=176408
So I did an update today on my Pi 3 running Raspbian. 
Now when I try to connect to it using VNC from my PC, the VNC viewer goes "No matching security types". 
That's with RealVNC. I get the same error when running vncviewer in Solaris 10. 
If I try TightVNC on the PC, I get "No security types supported". 
Oddly enough, the VNC Viewer app for Android works fine

From there I opened the VNC server window. From there I went to the Options menu, 
set Authentication to "VNC password" and Encryption to "Prefer off". I then clicked OK and that was that. I can now log into the Pi using RealVNC and TightVNC from my PC's again.

ARM code in github https://github.com/rgplantz/itco_ARM/tree/main

Thank you, Jobutex, for the kind words about my book. It's being used in the classroom for the first time this semester at Sonoma State University and Santa Rosa Jr. College. I'm sure there will be changes as I receive feedback from the students. :-) And I would very much like to hear comments from any readers, especially errors or suggested improvements. I maintain a log of changes under the "Errata" tab on my main web page.

Note that the last chapter is an assembly language introduction to programming the GPIO. The intent of my explanation is to help the reader to understand how to read the Broadcom datasheet, and the reasons for using /dev/mem and the mmap function. I think this chapter would be useful even for those who will be programming the GPIO in higher level languages.

https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/rpii/cintro.html   C.1 Introductions to C ProgrammingThis is a short and quick introduction to programming in C. This section is aimed at anybody who is interested new to programming and may wish to exploring the libRPii source files. The examples and exercise are designed to provide enough references and experience such that even complete beginners can still make the most out of the exploring libRPii tools. All of the source code examples (with prefix ExS.) can be found in the libRPii example source packages. See section GS.2 about how to get these resources.

really interesting GPU ON PI 2014 https://petewarden.com/2014/08/07/how-to-optimize-raspberry-pi-code-using-its-gpu/

updated library from This project, V3dLib, makes programming for the GPU more accessible. It builds upon a previous project, QPULib, and adds support for the Pi 4, which has a different GPU model

 https://github.com/wimrijnders/V3DLib/tree/main         V3DLib Version 0.7.15 V3DLib is a C++ library for creating programs to run on the VideoCore GPU's of all versions of the Raspberry Pi. Prior to the Pi 4, this meant compiling for just the VideoCore IV GPU. The Pi 4, however, has a VideoCore VI GPU which, although related, is significantly different. V3DLib compiles and assembles for both versions of the VideoCore GPU

https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Cygwin_HowTo.html#mingw   How to install MinGW-w64 GCC Compiler

https://www.mingw-w64.org/  Mingw-w64 is an advancement of the original mingw.org project, created to support the GCC compiler on Windows systems. It has forked it in 2007 in order to provide support for 64 bits and new APIs. It has since then gained widespread use and distribution.

You can install MinGW-w64 via MSYS2 (https://www.msys2.org/), which provides up-to-date native builds of GCC, Mingw-s64 and other helpful C++ tool and libraries..

I installed in C:\devel\msys64

after installation install gcc
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc

https://www.devdungeon.com/content/how-setup-gcc-msys2-eclipse-windows-c-development
but you want to at a minimum make sure your PATH variable includes the directories with make and g++.

change path in 'Advanced System Settings'
C:\devel\msys64\mingw64\bin
C:\devel\msys64\usr\bin
