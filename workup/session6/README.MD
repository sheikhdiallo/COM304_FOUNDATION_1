# Session 6 

In this session we will start by looking at how to use Assembler and C code to manipulate 7 segment displays simulated in the CPULator.

We will then look at using Assembler and C for real on the Raspberry PI.

# Exercises

Start by Looking at [CPULator Seven Segment Displays](../session6/cpulator/sevensegment/sevenSegmentDisplayExamples.md) 

Then look at the [Raspberry PI Assembler and C examples](../session6/raspberry\RaspberryPiCcode.md)
