# Seven Segment Display Examples

In this exercise we will continue our exploration of manipulating hardware devices by looking at the 7 segment displays on the CPULator.

Seven Segment displays are a technology which can display numerics and symbols using just seven LEDs.
You can see more about symbol mapping in the [Wikipedia 7 segment displays article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display)

In the CPUlator, there are 8 separate seven segment displays controlled by two 32 bit registers.

The displays are controlled by 2 registers located at the following addresses:

```
0xFF200020
0xFF200030
```

Below are links for documentation on the displays

## Exercise 1

In this first assembler program, we write to the two registers so that the lowest digit displays `1` and the upper digits are all turned off.

Try compiling the assembler program [simple7seg1.s](../sevensegment/code/simple7seg1.s) by pasting the program into the Editor panel, selecting `ARM7`, and pressing `compile`.

You will see the disassembled code.

Now press `continue` and the led displays should display `1`

You now need to work out which bits in the register control which display segments.

You then need to create a table which maps all of the hex symbols 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f onto their equivalent 8 bit byte which will drive the 7 segment display


```
Hex One 1  0x01

0b0000110 (0x06)

    |
    |
    
Hex Eight 0x08

0b1111111 (0x7F)
   _
  |_|
  |_|

```

| hex number | display bits |
|:-----------|:-------------|
|     0x01   |   0x06       |
|     0x02   |              |
|     etc    |              |
|     0x08   |   0x7F       |



Now modify the [simple7seg1.s](../sevensegment/code/simple7seg1.s) program to display `12345678`
