# Session 7
In [session6](../session6/) we started looking at the core functions of an operating system kernel.
In this session we will begin looking at the wider structure and utilities of operating systems and in particular Linux.

Start by looking at [Operating System Structure](../session7/docs/operating-systems-structure.md) 

Then see if you can install the [Apache 2 web server on your Raspberry Pi](../session7/docs/package-management-apache.md)
