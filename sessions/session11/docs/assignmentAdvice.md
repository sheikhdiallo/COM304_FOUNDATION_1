# Assignment advice

*Read the assignment and understand the marking criteria*

Your submission should use github markdown created within your forked repository.
A starting template is provided within your [Personal Learning Record](../../../myPracticeCourseWork/personal_learning_record) but this is for guidance only. 
You can format and order your learning record in the most useful way you see fit but remember that part of the assignment is to demonstrate that you know how to effectively write documentation using markdown.

You will submit a zipped snapshot of your repository on SOL but I will be marking the material linked to on github.
Make sure I have a link to your repository on [2024 Students](../../../2024-students.md)

## Project plan
You need to demonstrate a github project plan which has tracked all of the exercises covered in class. 
This is for you to track which exercises you have completed and your note taking on the key topics.

List of all of the exercises in project columns:
* to do
* in progress
* done

See the [example Project](https://github.com/users/gallenc/projects/5) which I used to plan this module.

## Weekly personal notes
You need to demonstrate that you have engaged with the lecture material and done your own supporting research.
For each topic covered, you should at least attempt to answer the following questions:

1. Why is this topic considered important for a foundations of computing module?
2. What were the key learning points from the lecture material?
3. How did I solve any assignment problems or programming exercises
3. Evidence of my additional personal research?

    * Link / reference?
    * Key points in this reference?
    * Why is it a good reference?
   
4. What next steps could I take to consolidate my knowledge of this topic?
    * tutorials, practices, books, courses or other material you have identified 


## Personal Reflection (2500 words)

If you have followed the process of writing notes on what you have learned after each session, this should be relatively easy to do.

### Summary of Personal Learning

* What did I expect to learn from this module?
* Was there any material which I did not expect to be in this module?
* What new things did I learn which I had not considered before?
* What surprised me? 
* What really interested me?
* What material just recapped which I already knew?
* What left me confused and why?
* What was missing from the module or could have been covered in more depth?
* How has this foundation module equipped me to progress further in computer science?

### Responsibility for my own learning
* What was my role and what was the lecturers role in advancing my learning?
* What steps did I take to get the maximum value out of this module?
* How did I take advantage of all the learning opportunities?
* How could I have done better?

### Future Progress
* How has this module equipped me to progress in learning computer science?
* What obstacles do I need to overcome to allow me to progress in computer science?
* What do I need to learn next to help me to acquire a more useful knowledge of computing?
