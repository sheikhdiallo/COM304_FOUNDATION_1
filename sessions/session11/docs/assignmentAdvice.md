# Assignment advice

*Read the assignment* and *understand the marking criteria*

Your submission should use github markdown created within your forked repository.
A starting template is provided within your [Personal Learning Record](../../../myPracticeCourseWork/personal_learning_record) but this is for guidance only. 
You can format and order your learning record in the most useful way you see fit but remember that part of the assignment is to demonstrate that you know how to effectively write documentation using markdown.

You will submit a zipped snapshot of your repository on SOL but I will be marking the material linked to on github.
Make sure I have a link to your repository on [2024 Students](../../../2024-students.md)

## Project plan
You need to demonstrate a github project plan which has tracked all of the exercises covered in class. 
This is for you to track whhich exercises you have completed and your note taking on the key topics.

List of all of the exercises in project columns:
* not started
* in progress
* completed

## Weekly personal notes
You need to demonstrate that you have engaged with the lecture material and done your own supporting research.
For each topic covered, you should at least attempt ot answer the following questions

1. Why is this topic considered important for a foundations of computing module?
2. What were the key learning points from the lecture material?
3. How did I solve any assignment problems or programming exercises
3. Evidence of my additional personal research?

    * Link / reference?
    * Key points in this material?
    * Why is it a good reference?
   
4. What next steps could I take to consolidate my knowledge of this topic?
    * tutorials, practices, books, courses or other material you have identified 


## Personal Reflection (2500 words)

If you have followed the process of writing notes on what you have learned after each session, this should be relatively easy to do.
