# Session 12 Wrap Up

This is the final opportunity to complete any class exercises.

Take this opportunity to

* Ask for help where you are stuck.
* Begin to fill in the learning record sections of your report if you have not already started.

The following [assignment advice](../session11/docs/assignmentAdvice.md) will give you guidance as to the content you should create for each session.
