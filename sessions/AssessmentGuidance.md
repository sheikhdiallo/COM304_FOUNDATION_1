# Assessment Guidance

This is not exactly aligned with the current module structure but should give you some idea of want we expect you to write after each session.

|Week|Tasks|Required Elements/Artefacts|Supporting Written Commentary|Evidenced By|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|1|PC Components|Investigatory report on PC components such as CPUs, GPUs, and motherboards.|Report should demonstrate an understanding of computer architecture with evidence of selecting appropriate hardware.|Detailed report and specifications list.|
|2|System Unit Components|Report on system unit components including cooling systems and power supplies.|Evidence of understanding component compatibility and energy efficiency in enterprise environments.|Component list and setup documentation.|
|3|Storage Devices and Power Supplies|Comparative analysis of SSDs, HDDs, and power supply units.|Discussion should highlight considerations for data security and power management strategies.|Comparison chart and recommendations.|
|4|Peripherals and External Devices|Selection and setup procedures for monitors, printers, and other devices.|Commentary on the operational requirements and maintenance of peripherals in a business setting.|Setup guides and maintenance schedules.|
|5|Networking Concepts|Design document for SME network including hardware and layout choices.|Explanation of network design choices and their alignment with business operations.|Network diagrams and hardware invoices.|
|6|Network Protocols and Services|Setup and configuration report for network services like DHCP, DNS.|Analysis should connect the choice of protocols and services to network efficiency and security.|Configuration logs and performance reports.|
|7|Project Management|Project plan for the overall IT setup including timelines and roles.|Commentary should reflect project management methodologies and tools used in planning and execution.|Project plan document and Gantt charts.|
|8|Security Concepts and Best Practices|Security plan including risk assessments and chosen security measures.|Detailed discussion on the implementation of security practices and their effectiveness.|Security setup and audit reports.|
|9|Troubleshooting Hardware and Software Issues|Troubleshooting diary documenting issues and resolutions during setup.|Demonstrates problem-solving skills and understanding of common IT issues with practical solutions.|Troubleshooting logs and resolution summaries.|
|10|Operating Systems|Report on the installation and configuration of chosen operating systems.|Explanation should detail the choice of operating systems based on business needs and security considerations.|OS setup documentation and configuration settings.|
|11|Mobile Devices mobile software/IDEs |Setup and management protocols for mobile devices and IDEs.|Detailed discussion on mobile device management and IDE usage within the business network. Emphasize how mobile software/IDEs enhance productivity and support business operations.|Device management policies and implementation reports.12|Cloud Computing and Virtualisation|Implementation report on cloud services and virtualisation strategies adopted by the business.|Commentary should evaluate the impact of cloud solutions on business scalability and flexibility.|Cloud service contracts and virtualisation performance reports.|

This table structures the tasks and their requirements in a detailed manner, providing a clear guide on how the assessment should be conducted and documented. Each entry is designed to ensure that you provide evidence of your technical knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and practical application skills in real-world scenarios.

All artefacts should be formally presented in conjunction with the corresponding reports where necessary. You MUST label each task appropriately, for example, tasks on Networking will be labelled “Networking”.  
Tasks are expected to be completed on an ongoing basis and you should request regular feedback for an improvement on your work before your final submission. 
Many of the tasks covered in this unit are knowledge required for the understanding foundation of computing unit and subsequently, leading to the understanding of high-level computer techniques and tools requires in the real world, particularly in today’s industry. Therefore, it is important that you aim to achieve a high level of understanding rather than just aiming towards the completion of the tasks and assignments. 

For each task, you must provide a commentary that evidences your understanding of computer architecture, functioning, and the application of IT in solving enterprise-level problems. This commentary should demonstrate thorough research, problem-solving skills, and the ability to apply project management tools and security best practices effectively.
