# Session 6 

In this session, we will start by looking at the [structure of a modern operating system](../session6/docs/operating-systems.md).

We will then continue our investigation into Assembler and C code on the CPUlator before looking at using Assembler and C for real on the Raspberry PI.


# Exercises

Start by looking at how to use Assembler and C code to manipulate 7 segment displays simulated in the CPUlator.

[CPUlator Seven Segment Displays](../session6/cpulator/sevensegment/sevenSegmentDisplayExamples.md) 

Then look at the [Raspberry PI Assembler and C examples](../session6/raspberry/RaspberryPiCcode.md)
