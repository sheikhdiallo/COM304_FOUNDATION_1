# Session 2 Introducing Computer Architecture

## Introduction

In this session, we will consolidate looking at Github and begin looking at computer architecture.

Computer architecture is a description of the structure of a computer system made from it's component parts.

We will start with an overview of computer architectures and then dive into how boolean logic implemented in logic gates can be used to do binary arithmetic. 

We will then look at how increasingly complex combinational logic based on simple logic gates and can be used create a central processing unit (CPU). 

## Introducing Computer Architecture

Presentation: [Computer Architecture](../session2/docs/com304-foundation-computer-Architecture-1.0.pdf)


## Github clone and merge

You should already have created your github account.

You should have already created some notes in your personal learning record

You now need to clone your forked repository on to your pc and merge it with my latest branch.

To do this, you will need to install git on your own machine. 

See [download git for windows https://git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)

Once GIT is installed, you will need to generate your own public and private keys and clone your repository.

You now need to follow the instructions in [Introduction to Github](../../../main/introductionToGitHub.md) 

Check out the repo on your local PC.

Later you will also check out your repo on your Raspberry Pi

## Binary and Boolean 

We have seen that with the exception of analogue and quantum computing, computers generally use binary signals 1 and 0 for all of their operations.

It is important to get familiar with Binary Arithmetic. 

Please go through the [Binary Arithmetic examples](../session2/docs/binaryArithmetic.md)

Boolean Algebra is the basis of computing. 
You need to be familiar with the basics of AND, OR, NOT etc.

Computer architectures rely on the use of `logic gates` which manipulate binary signals .

This is not an electronics course, but it is useful to understand the basics of digital logic gates in order to appreciate how computers use boolean algebra to do arithmetic and run programs.

Please go through the [Boolean Algebra examples](../session2/docs/booleanAlgebraAndLogicGates.md)
