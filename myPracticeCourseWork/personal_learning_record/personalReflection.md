# Personal Reflection COM 304 Foundation

## Summary of Personal Learning


I came into this module with no prior computing skills or knowledge so expected to really struggle however I felt I kept up with the pace and ended up enjoying computing more then I thought. Therefore, I really had no idea on what to expect to learn from this module as it was all new to me.


I thought the cyber security, on networking academy, was surprising as I am moving onto software engineering when I start my bachelor’s degree however I found it very insightful, and it gave me something to think about for the future as there are so many career opportunities due to the high demand for experts and its interdisciplinary nature.


I feel like I did not consider binary to be significant as it is. This is because in early sessions we learned that binary is the foundation of digital communications. Despite using only 0s and 1s its simplicity allows computers to perform complex tasks through combinations of those two states. I also did not consider the internet to be as young as it is founded in 1969 ARPANET it has developed rapidly displaying how impressive and now significant computer science Is as I would not even be typing right or attempting to pursue a career in software if it wasn’t for its rapid development.

What surprised me was how simple and universal binary in computing is. As its core, binary relies on just two states “0” and “1” to represent and process all kinds of data such as complex algorithms. The minimalistic aspect of binary contrasts sharply with the complexity of computer science and modern technology, where these simple steps enable the operation of powerful supercomputers, smartphones and the internet. The elegance of binary is displayed through its adaptability it aligns perfectly with the “on” and “off” states of electronic circuits, this therefore makes it the natural language of all machines.


What really interested me about cloud networking is how it transforms the way we think about accessing and managing resources. At first, I was amazed by the idea that data and applications could exist somewhere "out there," accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. It felt almost magical, yet entirely practical. The scalability is what really grasped my attention, how businesses can instantly expand or reduce their resources without investing in physical infrastructure. I also found the collaborative aspect fascinating. The ability to work on the same project with others in real-time, no matter where they are in the world, seemed revolutionary. Security and redundancy also intrigued me; the thought that data could be safeguarded and quickly restored after a disaster felt empowering. To me, cloud networking represents a perfect blend of flexibility, and innovation, making it one of the most exciting advancements in modern technology.

What left me confused during this course was the work done on CPUlator this was mainly due to the fact I missed both tutorial sessions one which was due to illness and the other just because I was being lazy. As someone who wants to do well in In university, I found that this did effect my understanding and ability to work on the practical’s because I could not get the necessary support needed due to fault of my own.

I feel this foundation module was extremely beneficial for someone in my position as we done lots of practical work which I believe made the content easier to understand as we applied most of the content we covered. This foundation module as gave me a good base of knowledge about computing which in favour should make the next modules and 3 years much easier then they would be if I didn’t opt for it.

## Responsibility for my own learning

My role in advancing my learning was doing research out of lesson putting in the extra work to get the most out of this module. My lectures roll in advancing my learning was providing examples of content and helping students and myself when necessary. What I did to maximise my own learning was learn and play around on the Gitbash terminal to make the raspberry pi easier to understand for future lessons I also completed the cyber security course on cisco which was provided by my lecturer. I felt I did take advantage of a lot of my learning opportunities but was inconsistent with my attendance which held me back for those weeks I missed. What I could have done better was ask more questions especially in the early stages so in weeks 5 and 6 I wouldn’t have been as confused and would’ve been able to crack on with learning instead of playing catch up.

# Future Progress
I feel like this foundation module has helped me significantly with the project managment side of computer science as in we have had to keep all our work organised projects seperate e.t.c.
