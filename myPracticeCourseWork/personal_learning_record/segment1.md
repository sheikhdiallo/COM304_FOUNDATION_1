## session 1 : We learned how to fork and edit docs. In the 2nd hour we began using Raspberry Pi and had it all set up, however we could not access the internet on it therefore i did not complete my task to my best abillity.

## session 2  In the  first half of this session we went over computer architectures and the history of computing. This helped me gain a basic knowledge of computing and definitions. We ended off the session by decoding a 4 Bit CPU and i done this by breaking it down into sections. I started with the binary code then the hexadecimal code and this helped me gain a better understanding to access the information given to me. At the start of this lesson/ Lecture we went through boolean algebra and im am currently trying to memorise the numbers and letters for the hexadecimals. 

## session 3 In session 3 we used a Rapberry Pi and an app called Node Red to work LED lights and used aa variaation of raspberry pi called wiring pi to maanipulate the LED lights to be worked like traffic lights. At the start we installed our Raspberry Pi on the monitors which then we installed Node Red which took more then one attmpt due to the internet (wifi) disconnecting. We then used Mr Potters example which was of a breadboard to construct our own version of traffic lights. Me and my team then expirimented on the application local host for a few minuites before downloading Mr Potters Example.

## session 4 (consolidate)
