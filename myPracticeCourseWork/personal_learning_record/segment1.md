## Session 1

# Introduction

# Installing a raspberry pi

In session 1 we were introduced to a raspberry pi which is a small single board computer originally designed for education but now also widely used in industrial applications. In this session we used the 16G micro SD card to install the operating system we then went onto the raspberry pi ([Raspberry Pi OS â€“ Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)) to install the imager. We then ran it and were told to run a blank miniSD card into a built in SD card reader. Then we used instructions to run the raspberry pi which me and my partner had a minor issue with because of the internet (wifi). However to solve this we reset the machine and opened a terminal to type in the machine code ( python eduroam-linux-SUS.py ) to run the internet which therefore allowed the raspberry pi to work. We then opened aa browser on the internet and shut down our raspberry pi. This practical task was a good foundation for us students as it allowed us to access raspberry pi easily in further sessions.

## Session 2
In the  first half of this session we went over computer architectures and the history of computing. This helped me gain a basic knowledge of computing and definitions. We ended off the session by decoding a 4 Bit CPU and i done this by breaking it down into sections. I started with the binary code then the hexadecimal code and this helped me gain a better understanding to access the information given to me. At the start of this lesson/ Lecture we went through boolean algebra and im am currently trying to memorise the numbers and letters for the hexadecimals. 

## Session 3
In session 3 we used a Rapberry Pi and an app called Node Red to work LED lights and used aa variaation of raspberry pi called wiring pi to maanipulate the LED lights to be worked like traffic lights. At the start we installed our Raspberry Pi on the monitors which then we installed Node Red which took more then one attmpt due to the internet (wifi) disconnecting. We then used Mr Potters example which was of a breadboard to construct our own version of traffic lights. Me and my team then expirimented on the application local host for a few minuites before downloading Mr Potters Example.
