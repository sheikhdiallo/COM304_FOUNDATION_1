## session 1 : We learned how to fork and edit docs. In the 2nd hour we began using Raspberry Pi and had it all set up, however we could not access the internet on it therefore i did not complete my task to my best abillity

## session 2  On tuesday the 8th of january we ended off by decoding a 4 Bit CPU and i done this by breaking it down into sections. I started wuth the binary code then the hexadecimal code and this helped me gain a better understanding to access the information given to me. At the start of this lesson/ Lecture we went through boolean algebra and im am currently trying to memorise the numbers and letters for the hexadecimals. 

## session 3
