## The Origins of Linux Operating System

In the 70s At&t developed the original C programming language, This was used to write a new operating system called Unix . Unix and C became increasingly popular and computer manufacturers began developing their own variants to run there own workstations;

- HPUX-Hewlett Packard
- Solaris- Sun Microsystems
- AIX- IBM
- Ultrix – Digital Equipment Coporation

The CPU’s underlying these systems were significantly different with IBM hardware using PA-RISC processors Sun using SPARC (Scalable Processor ARChitecture)

In theory, a program written in C to run on a Unix OS could run on any og these variants, However as there were difference this was not the case. Therefore, this lead to the development of the POSIX Compliant Unix standard ( defines a standard threading library API which is supported by most modern operating systems (2008) which standardised the system calls across unix systems.

Similar to this, Richard Stallman who was a researcher at MIT, became annoyed due to the way companies were hiding details of their operating systems through the use of ‘closed source’ therefore keeping the programs private. In 1983 Stallman resigned from MIT and began developing a Unix style operating system which would be free for anyone to use and would be published as an open-sourced program. He also developed a gcc complier and many different software utilities were released as part of the GNU project (A operating system that is free software).

A key innovation was to publish the software under the Copy Left GPL licens e ( a series of widely used free software licences, or copyleft licenses, that guarantee end users the freedoms to run, study, share and modify the software), which forced whoever copied or extended the source code to publish their work under the same license.

During the 1990’s, Linus Torvalds performed a masters project trying to develop a Unix kernel which would work on low cost Intel Processors. He discovered the GNU project in 1991 and realised that the kernel he was developing could be combined with GNU utilities to create a fully open source operating system. (incomplete notes)
