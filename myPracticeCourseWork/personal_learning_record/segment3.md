Images of the map of the internet-

The Victorian Internet discusses the impact of the telegraph on the world

Morse Code

- Messsages relayed between stations
- The impact the internet had in the Victorian times was far more significant then it is today
- Letters as numbers

Morse Code

- Byte = 8 bits = 10101010
- 1kb=1024 bytes
- Characters are bytes (ASCII)
- Sound or pictures collections of bytes

DARPAnet was brought about around 1960-1970s

Cold war- Self Healing and self organisation capibilitys due to potential nuclear annihilation

IP Addresses

- Every device has at least one IP address
- Example of IPv4: 66.94.29.13 (32 bits)
- All were used up on the 31<sup>st</sup> of January 2011

Automatc Maps- RO=outing Records

Routers are dumb- receive a packet on one port and send it out a different route

Routing Protocols

How routers find each other automatically

\-Inferior Routing Records

\-exchanging routing table information between routers within an autonomous system

\-Exterior Gateway Protocols

Exchange routing info between autonomous systems

DNS – Electronic Telephone Book

Phone number - telephone book

Domain Name System- translating human readable addresses to ip addresses

- Microchips
- 1971 Intel invents 4004
- 4 bit microproccesor
- Gordon Moore – Moore’s Law
- Majority of the chips in the world are built in Taiwan TSMC manufacture for many different organizations not just one unlike intel

1980\`s – Personal Computers

Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire

Invented the Turing machine – core concepts for a modern computer

- Electronic commerce needed

Secure communications

Guarantee you are talking to the correct machine or person

A way to securely distribute

# Microsoft Azure- Virtual Machines

In this section I used Microsoft Azure to create a cloud-based system. We then created an account and used the IP Address to login to it via PuTTY. Ones this was completed we did the same with just with a web page we created which we created and then uploaded and accessed this via PuTTY. I also accessed the self-turn off section as if I don’t turn off Microsoft Azure when I’m not on it my account is still charged for credits. When we finished, we deleted the Project.
